Earlier query : multiple auction amount

select id from bid where auction_id = (select auction_id, amount from bid group by amount, auction_id))

Select b.bidder, b.amount
from bids b
where b.amount in (select amount from bids as sub where sub.auction_id = b.auction_id
group by amount having count(*) = 1) order by b.auction_id, b.amount;
