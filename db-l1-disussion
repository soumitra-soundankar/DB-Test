    You are required to produce a solution to perform credit card number validation according to the Luhn algorithm below. This will be used for web-based validations and therefore should be tolerant of edge conditions and invalid data scenarios which can be exhibited on a website. In addition, it is required to support the entry of credit card numbers both with spaces and without spaces and to validate each of these appropriately.
    You should prove its operation through test cases.
    The Luhn Algorithm
    The formula verifies a number against its included check-digit, which is usually appended to a partial account number to generate the full account number. This account number must pass the following test:
    Counting from the check digit, which is the rightmost, and moving left, double the value of every second digit.
    Sum the digits of the products together with the un-doubled digits from the original number.
    If the total ends in 0 (put another way, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.
    Examples
    4556 7375 8689 9855	Valid
    4556737586899855	Valid
    4024 0071 0902 2143	Not valid
